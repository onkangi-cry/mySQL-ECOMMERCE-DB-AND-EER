Functions are blocks of reusable codes
$ Sign is used as an acessor
To have a function we can do the following
a)function function_name(parameters:what is going to be here)
parameters are variables listed in a function definition
Arguments are values passed to the function when it is called.
b)function logic
c)return value which is optional
return states how  a function should display when called.Without it it will display as undefined,
For instance
function greet(name){
  return 'Hello ,${name}!
}
console.log(greet('Eddy'))

An example of a fully functional function
function greet(name){
  return greet ${name}
}
greet('Anderson')


function sum(a,b){
return a+b
}
value=sum(1,2)
console.log(value)
After return there is nothing else ever gonna run.
 


 LOOPS
 This is what ou have been doing wrong Onkangi
 This is how  a for loop is written
 for (initialExpression[we can use let];condition[we compare it to a value with the number of times we want it to run];increment expression){
  statement[console.log()]
 }
 For instance

 for (let i=0;i<5;i++){
  console.log("Hello World")
 }
